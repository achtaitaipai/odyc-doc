# <Emoji src="✨" /> Welcome to the Odyc.js Documentation

Odyc.js is a tiny JavaScript library designed to create narrative games by combining pixels, sounds, text, and a bit of logic.  
Everything is built **through code**, but without unnecessary complexity: your entire game can fit in a single file.

## <Emoji src="🎮" /> One Function to Make a Game

Creating a game with Odyc.js is as simple as calling `createGame()`.  
You provide your sprites, dialogs, sounds, and interactions — and the engine takes care of the rest.

```js
createGame({
	player: {
		sprite: 7,
		position: [2, 5]
	},
	map: `
		########
		#......#
		#..X...#
		#......#
		########
	`,
	templates: {
		X: {
			sprite: 4,
			dialog: 'Hello, adventurer!'
		}
	}
})
```

### 🧱 World Building

Define the player, the map, sprites, sounds, and dialogs.

### ⚙️ Interaction & Logic

Make your world interactive using events and game actions.

### 🎨 Configuration

Customize the appearance, filters, controls, colors, and screen.
